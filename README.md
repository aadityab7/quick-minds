***“Online Learning Community Enhanced by AI” - “One fun stop for all learning needs”***

It is a web application that aims to change the way users seek information and knowledge online. 

We want to make online learning fun by tailoring the experience according to your needs and preferences. And provide rapid, reliable, and insightful responses to users' questions by merging the strengths of **artificial intelligence (AI)** with the power of **human expertise**.

Current AI systems are fast but not 100% reliable in terms of accuracy, on the other hand the online communities offer the benefit of human expertise and fact checking but are slow in terms of response time. We want to combine the best of both worlds and create an experience where we can get a quick AI response and get resources related to the unique problems across various domains and then experts can dive deeper and verify the results and suggest better alternatives.

We also want to provide “Custom Quizzes” made for the user according to their interests and experience level generated using AI. 
On our platform experts will also be able to share their knowledge using Blogs and Articles, which can help the community learn from each other's experiences.
